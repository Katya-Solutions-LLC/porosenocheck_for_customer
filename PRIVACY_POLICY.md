# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: January 2026*

## 1. Introduction

PorosenoCheck ("we", "our", "us") is an open-source, decentralized solution for monitoring, care, and assistance for domestic and wild animals. This Privacy Policy describes how data is handled within the PorosenoCheck ecosystem and related client applications, nodes, and services.

PorosenoCheck is designed with **privacy by design**, **data minimization**, and **decentralization** as core principles.

## 2. Scope

This Privacy Policy applies to:

* The PorosenoCheck customer application
* Self-hosted regional or private PorosenoCheck nodes
* Related open-source repositories under Katya Solutions LLC / REChain Network Solutions

It does **not** apply to third-party services or infrastructure independently deployed by node operators.

## 3. Core Privacy Principles

* **No central server**: PorosenoCheck does not rely on a single centralized backend.
* **Local-first**: Data is processed and stored locally or within the node chosen by the user or operator.
* **User control**: Users decide what data to share and with whom.
* **Transparency**: Source code is publicly available for audit and verification.

## 4. Data We Do Not Collect

By default, PorosenoCheck does **not** collect:

* Personal identification data (name, passport, ID numbers)
* Advertising identifiers
* Location data without explicit user consent
* Behavioral tracking or analytics for advertising

## 5. Data That May Be Processed

Depending on configuration and user actions, the following data **may** be processed:

* Animal-related information (species, health status, care records)
* User-provided notes or reports
* Technical metadata required for node-to-node communication (e.g., timestamps, node identifiers)

All such data remains under the control of the node operator or the end user.

## 6. Decentralized Nodes and Responsibility

Each PorosenoCheck node is independently operated.

* Node operators are responsible for complying with local data protection laws
* Data storage duration and access policies are defined by the node configuration
* Katya Solutions LLC does not have automatic access to node data

## 7. Data Sharing

PorosenoCheck does not sell or monetize user data.

Data may only be shared:

* With explicit user consent
* Between nodes as part of decentralized functionality
* When required by applicable law (handled by the node operator)

## 8. Security Measures

Security practices include:

* Cryptographic signatures and verification
* Optional end-to-end encryption
* Open-source security review

However, no system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Users and node operators are encouraged to follow best security practices.

## 9. Children’s Privacy

PorosenoCheck is not designed to collect personal data from children. If a node operator processes such data, they are responsible for obtaining appropriate consent under applicable law.

## 10. International Use

PorosenoCheck is used globally. Data may be stored and processed in different jurisdictions depending on node deployment. Users should be aware of local data protection regulations.

## 11. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated as the project evolves.

* Updates will be reflected in the repository history
* Continued use of the software constitutes acceptance of the updated policy
